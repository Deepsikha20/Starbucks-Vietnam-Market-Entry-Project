Project Overview
This project reimagines the traditional business strategy document. Instead of a static, multi-page PDF, it translates a comprehensive market analysis and strategic plan into a dynamic, engaging, and easily digestible web experience. The core objective is to demonstrate how complex business information—including market data, competitive analysis, strategic frameworks, and financial projections—can be made more accessible and impactful for stakeholders through effective data visualization and interactive design.

The application guides the user through the strategic narrative of "Project Phoenix," a plan designed to reverse Starbucks' decade of underperformance in the vibrant Vietnamese coffee market.

The Strategic Blueprint: Key Recommendations
The interactive report is built around the four core pillars of the "Project Phoenix" strategy:

A "Dual-Stream" Product Strategy: Shifting from a purely Arabica-based menu to embrace local taste preferences by introducing a premium "Starbucks Reserve: Vietnam Robusta" line, while curating the global menu with local flavors.

A Tiered Store & Pricing Architecture: Moving beyond a single store format to a dual model featuring large, experiential Flagship "Reserve" Stores and smaller, convenient "Starbucks Connect" Kiosks to compete on both brand experience and daily accessibility.

Reclaiming the "Third Place": Authentically localizing the in-store experience through design, ambiance, and community engagement to align with the social, communal nature of Vietnamese café culture.

A New Marketing Narrative: Repositioning the brand from a foreign import to a committed partner by launching a campaign centered on the message of "celebrating and elevating Vietnamese coffee."

Features
Narrative-Driven Interface: The application is structured as a compelling story, guiding users logically from the problem to the solution.
